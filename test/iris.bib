	abstract = {Supervised high-level synthesis (HLS) is a new class of design problems where exploration strategies play the role of supervisor for tuning an HLS engine. The complexity of the problem is increased due to the large set of tunable parameters exposed by the “new wave” of HLS tools that include not only architectural alternatives but also compiler transformations. In this paper, we developed a novel exploration approach, called spectral-aware Pareto iterative refinement, that exploits response surface models (RSMs) and spectral analysis for predicting the quality of the design points without resorting to costly architectural synthesis procedures. We show that the target solution space can be accurately modeled through RSMs, thus enabling a speedup of the overall exploration without compromising the quality of results. Furthermore, we introduce the usage of spectral techniques to find high variance regions of the design space that require analysis for improving the RSMs prediction accuracy.},

	abstract = {The design space exploration (DSE) phase is used to tune configurable system parameters and it generally consists of a multiobjective optimization (MOO) problem. It is usually done at pre-design phase and consists of the evaluation of large design spaces where each configuration requires long simulation. Several heuristic techniques have been proposed in the past and the recent trend is reducing the exploration time by using analytic prediction models to approximate the system metrics, effectively pruning sub-optimal configurations from the exploration scope. However, there is still a missing path towards the effective usage of the underlying computing resources used by the DSE process. In this work, we will show that an alternative and almost orthogonal approach - focused on exploiting the available parallelism in terms of computing resources - can be used to better schedule the simulations and to obtain a high speedup with respect to state of the art approaches, without compromising the accuracy of exploration results. Experimental results will be presented by dealing with the DSE problem of a shared memory multi-core system considering a variable number of available parallel resources to support the DSE phase.},

	abstract = {The ever increasing number of processing units integrated on the same many-core chip delivers computational power that can exceed the performance requirements of a single application. The number of chips (and related power consumption) can thus be reduced to serve multiple applications — a practice which is called resource consolidation. However, this solution requires techniques to partition and assign resources among the applications and to manage unpredictable dynamic workloads.
To provide the performance requirements in such scenarios, we exploit application auto-tuning, based on design-time analysis, of both application-specific dynamic knobs and computational parallelism. Such features are implemented in a software library, which is used to demonstrate the main contribution of this paper: a light-weight Run-Time Resource Management — RTRM — technique to improve resource sharing for computationally intensive OpenCL applications.
We evaluate how much the interaction between RTRM and application auto-tuning can become synergistic yet orthogonal. In the proposed approach, run-time adaptation decisions are taken by each application, autonomously. This has two main advantages: i) a non-invasive application design, in terms of source code, and ii) a very low run-time overhead, since it does not require any central coordination of a supervisor nor communication between the applications.
We carried out an experimental campaign by using a video processing application — an OpenCL stereo-matching implemen- tation — and stressing out resource usage. We proved that, while RTRM is necessary to provide lower variance of the application performance, the application auto-tuning layer is fundamental to trade it off with respect to the computation accuracy.},

This multi-objective optimization phase is called Design-Space Exploration (DSE). Among the design-time (hardware) configurable parameters we can find the memory subsystem configuration (such as cache size and associativity) and other architectural parameters such as the instruction-level parallelism of the system processors. Among the runtime (software) configurable parameters we can find the degree of task-level parallelism associated with each application running on the platform.

The contribution of this article is twofold; first, we introduce an evolutionary (NSGA-II-based) methodology for identifying a hardware configuration which is robust with respect to applications and corresponding datasets. Second, we introduce a novel runtime heuristic that exploits design-time identified operating points to provide guaranteed throughput to each application. Experimental results show that the design-time/runtime combined approach improves the runtime performance of the system with respect to existing reference techniques, while meeting the overall power budget.},

The proposed methodology provides the designer with an integrated framework to automatically (i) generate optimized application-specific VLIW architectural configurations and (ii) analyze compiler level transformations, enabling application-specific compiler tuning over customized VLIW system architectures. We based the aforementioned analysis on a Design of Experiments (DoEs) procedure that captures in a statistical manner the higher order effects among different sets of activated compiler transformations. Applying the proposed methodology onto real-case embedded application scenarios, we show that (i) only a limited set of compiler transformations exposes high confidence level (over 95%) in affecting the performance and (ii) using them we could be able to achieve gains between (16-23)% in comparison to the default optimization levels.},

	abstract = {Hardware coprocessors are extensively used in modern heterogeneous systems-on-chip (SoC) designs to provide efficient implementation of application-specific functions. Customized coprocessor synthesis exploits design space exploration to derive Pareto optimal design configurations for a set of targeted metrics. Existing exploration strategies for coprocessor synthesis have been focused on either time consuming iterative scheduling approaches or ad-hoc sampling of the solution space guided by the designer's experience. In this paper, we introduce a meta-model assisted exploration framework that eliminates the aforementioned drawbacks by using response surface models (RSMs) for generating customized coprocessor architectures. The methodology is based on the construction of analytical delay and area models for predicting the quality of the design points without resorting to costly architectural synthesis procedures. Various RSM techniques are evaluated with respect to their accuracy and convergence. We show that the targeted solution space can be accurately modeled through RSMs, thus enabling a speedup of the overall exploration runtime without compromising the quality of results. Comparative experimental results, over a set of real-life benchmarks, prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of quality improvements of the design solutions and exploration runtime reductions.

	abstract = {This paper presents an Application-specific Run-Time managEment (ARTE) framework to tackle the problem of managing computational resources in an application specific multi-core system. The ARTE framework run-time goal is to minimize applications’ response times while meeting the applications’ computational demands and fitting within the available power budget.

The approach addresses application specific embedded systems assuming that the set of target applications is known at design-time. In addition, it considers run-time scenarios that are unpredictable due to variable user activity and/or interaction with the external environment. ARTE takes decisions about resource distribution to the active applications at run-time once the system state is known.

ARTE leverages an analytical queuing model at run-time to predict the applications’ response times. The accuracy of this model is enhanced by accounting for contention overhead on the resources shared among the active applications. The analytical nature of the queuing model allows an estimation of the system performance with negligible overhead.

Finally we compared the proposed ARTE framework to state-of-the-art techniques to assess its benefits in terms of systems performance and run-time overhead for the selected set of parallel benchmarks.},

	journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN OF INTEGRATED CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS},
	volume = {21},
	abstract = {This paper presents OSCAR, an optimization methodology exploiting spatial correlation of multicore design spaces. This paper builds upon the observation that power consumption and performance metrics of spatially close design configurations (or points) are statistically correlated. We propose to exploit the correlation by using a response surface model (RSM), i.e., a closed-form expression suitable for predicting the quality of nonsimulated design points. This model is useful during the design space exploration (DSE) phase to quickly converge to the Pareto set of the multiobjective problem without executing lengthy simulations. To this end, we introduce a multiobjective optimization heuristic which iteratively updates and queries the RSM to identify the design points with the highest expected improvement. The RSM allows to consolidate the Pareto set by reducing the number of simulations required, thus speeding up the exploration process. We compare the proposed heuristic with state-of-the-art approaches [conventional, RSM-based, and struc- tured design of experiments (DoEs)]. Experimental results show that OSCAR is a faster heuristic with respect to state-of-the-art techniques such as response-surface Pareto iterative refinement ReSPIR and nondominated-sorting genetic algorithm NSGA-II. In fact, OSCAR used a lower number of simulations to produce a similar solution, i.e., an average of 150 simulations instead of 320 simulations (NSGA-II) and 178 simulations (ReSPIR). When the number of design points is fixed to an average of 300, OSCAR achieves less than 0.6% in terms of average distance with respect to the reference solution while NSGA-II achieves 3.4%. Reported results also show that OSCAR can significantly improve structured DoE approaches by slightly increasing the number of experiments.},

	abstract = {Open Computing Language (OpenCL) is emerging as a standard for parallel programming of heterogeneous hardware accelerators. With respect to device specific languages, OpenCL enables application portability but does not guarantee performance portability, eventually requiring additional tuning of the implementation to a specific platform or to unpredictable dynamic workloads. In this paper, we present a methodology to analyze the customization space of an OpenCL application in order to improve performance portability and to support dynamic adaptation. We formulate our case study by implementing an OpenCL image stereo-matching application (which computes the relative depth of objects from a pair of stereo images) customized to the STMicroelectronics Platform 2012 many-core computing fabric. In particular, we use design space exploration techniques to generate a set of operating points that represent specific configurations of the parameters allowing different trade-offs between performance and accuracy of the algorithm itself. These points give detailed knowledge about the interaction between the application parameters, the underlying architecture and the performance of the system; they could also be used by a run-time manager software layer to meet dynamic Quality-of-Service (QoS) constraints.

To analyze the customization space, we use cycle-accurate simulations for the target architecture. Since the profiling phase of each configuration takes a long simulation time, we designed our methodology to reduce the overall number of simulations by exploiting some important features of the application parameters; our analysis also enables the identification of the parameters that could be explored on a high-level simulation model to reduce the simulation time. The resulting methodology is one order of magnitude more efficient than an exhaustive exploration and, given its randomized nature, it increases the probability to avoid sub-optimal trade-offs.},

	abstract = {Resource run-time managers have been shown par- ticularly effective for coordinating the usage of the hardware resources by multiple applications, eliminating the necessity of a full-blown operating system. For this reason, we expect that this technology will be increasingly adopted in emerging multi- application reconfigurable systems.
This paper introduces a fully automated design flow that exploits multi-objective design space exploration to enable run- time resource management for the Molen reconfigurable archi- tecture. The entry point of the design flow is the application source code; our flow is able to heuristically determine a set of candidate hardware/software configurations of the application (i.e., operating points) that trade off the occupation of the reconfigurable fabric (in this case, an FPGA), the load of the master processor and the performance of the application itself. This information enables a run-time manager to exploit more efficiently the available system resources in the context of multiple applications.
We present the results of an experimental campaign where we applied the proposed design flow to two reference audio appli- cations mapped on the Molen architecture. The analysis proved that the overhead of the design space exploration and operating points extraction with respect to the original Molen flow is within reasonable bounds since the final synthesis time still represents the major contribution. Besides, we have found that there is a high variance in terms of execution time speedup associated with the operating points of the application (characterized by a different usage of the FPGA) which can be exploited by the run-time manager to increase/decrease the quality of service of the application depending on the available resources.},

	abstract = {Manufacturing process variation is dramatically becoming one of the most important challenges related to power and performance optimization for sub-90nm CMOS technologies. Process variability impacts the optimization of the target system metrics, that is, performance and energy consumption by introducing fluctuations and unpredictability. Besides, it impacts the parametric yield of the chip with respect to application level constraints by reducing the number of devices working within normal operating conditions.

The impact of variability on systems with stringent application-specific requirements (such as portable multimedia and critical embedded systems) is much greater than on general-purpose systems given the emphasis on predictability and reduced operating margins. In this market segment, failing to address such a problem within the early design stages of the chip may lead to missing market deadlines and suffering greater economic losses.

In the context of a design space exploration framework for supporting the platform-based design approach, we address the problem of robustness with respect to manufacturing process variations. First, we apply Response Surface Modeling (RSM) techniques to enable an efficient evaluation of the statistical measures of execution time and energy consumption for each system configuration. Then, we apply a robust design space exploration framework to afford the problem of the impact of manufacturing process variations onto the system-level metrics and consequently onto the application-level constraints. We finally provide a comparison of our design space exploration technique with conventional approaches on two different case studies.},

	abstract = {Toady’s embedded computing electronic products are based on multi-core plat- forms and they are capable to concurrently execute different applications.
For these products it is of paramount importance that a Run-time Resource Man- agement (RRM) system integrated in the Operating System (OS) arbiters about re- source allocation to the active applications. The RRM should take decisions at run- time to maximize platform performance and minimizing non-functional costs such as power consumption or memory requirements. However, embedded system design covers a broad range of applications and the customer requirements are very different depending on the target device. In general there is not an unique RRM that best fits in all possible embedded scenarios.
This paper presents the EMME Evaluation Framework, an open source tool that provides a methodology and the accompanying infrastructure to quickly explore the effects of different RRM systems for a target use case scenario. The tool aims at the analysis of different figures of merit of the system being designed such as the applications’ response time, system throughput and power consumption.
Different RRM modules are released with the framework. These modules imple- ment different RRM policies that define how to allocate computing resources to the active applications while fitting in a power budget that is assumed assigned by other layers of the OS.},

A lightweight run-time manager, linked with an automated design-time exploration and incorporated in the host processor of the platform, is required to dynamically and efficiently configure the applications according to the available platform resources (e.g. processing elements, memories, communication bandwidth), for minimising the cost (e.g. power consumption), while satisfying the constraints (e.g. deadlines). This study presents a flow linking a design-time design space explorer, coupled with platform simulators at two abstraction levels, with a fast and lightweight priority-based heuristic integrated in the run-time manager to select near-optimal application configurations. To illustrate its feasibility and the very low complexity of the run-time selection, the proposed flow is used to manage the processors and clock frequencies of a multiple-stream MPEG4 encoder chip dedicated to automotive cognitive safety applications.},

Moreover, current applications exhibit unpredictable changes of the environment and workload conditions which makes the task of running them optimally even more difficult. This dynamic trend in application runs will grow even more in future applications.
This Chapter presents an automated tool flow which tackles this challenge by a two-step approach: first at design-time, a Design Space Exploration (DSE) tool is coupled with a platform simulator(s) to get optimum operating points for the set of
target applications. Secondly, at run-time, a lightweight Run-time Resource Manager (RRM) leverages the design-timeDSEresults for deciding an operating configuration to be loaded at run-time for each application. This decision is performed dynamically,
by taking into consideration available platform resources and the QoS requirements of the specific use-case. To keepRRMexecution and resource overhead at minimum, a very fast optimisation heuristic is integrated. Application of this tool-flowon a real-life multimedia use case will demonstrate a significant speedup in optimisation process while maintaining desired Quality of Service.},

throughput, etc.). One of the important goals of the automatic multi-objective DSE framework is to find design trade-offs that best meet system constraints and cost criteria which are indeed strongly dependent on the target application. A set of heuristic
optimisation algorithms have been defined to reduce the overall optimization time by identifying an approximated Pareto set of parameter configurations with respect to a set of selected figures of merit. Once the approximated Pareto set is built, the
designer can quickly apply decision criteria to select the best configuration satisfying the constraints. The DSE flow is based on the interaction of two frameworks to be used at design time: the Design Space Exploration Framework, a set of opensource
and proprietary architectural exploration tools, and the Power/Performance Estimation Framework, a set of modeling and simulation tools (open-source and proprietary) operating at several levels of abstraction. The DSE flow also includes
the specification of an XML integration interface to connect the exploration and estimation frameworks and a Run-time Resource Manager exploiting, at run-time, the best software configuration alternatives derived at design-time to optimize the usage of system resources},

In particular the management of system resources for an MPSoC dedicated to multiple MPEG4 encoding is addressed in the context of an Automotive Cognitive Safety System (ACSS). The run-time management problem is defined as the minimization of the platform power consumption under resource and Quality of Service (QoS) constraints. The Chapter provides an insight of both, design-time and run-time aspects of the problem. During the prelimiary design-time Design Space Exploration (DSE)
phase, the best configurations of run-time tunable parameters are statically identified for providing the best trade-offs in terms of run-time costs and application QoS. To speed up the optimization process without reducing the quality of final results, a

At run-time, the RRM exploits the design-time DSE results for deciding an operating configuration to be loaded for each MPEG4 encoder. This operation is carried out dynamically, by following the QoS requirements of the specific use-case.},

	abstract = {A typical design space exploration flow involves an event-based simulator in the loop, often leading to an actual evaluation time that can exceed practical limits for realistic applications. Chip multi-processor architectures further exacerbate this problem given that the actual simulation speed decreases by increasing the number of cores of the chip. Traditional design space exploration lacks of efficient techniques that reduce the number of architectural alternatives to be analyzed. In this chapter,
we introduce a set of statistical and machine learning techniques that can be used to predict system level metrics by using closed-form analytical expressions instead of lengthy simulations; the latter are called Response Surface Models (RSM). The
principle of RSM is to exploit a set of simulations generated by one or more Design of Experiments strategies to build a surrogate model to predict the system-level metrics. The response model has the same input and output features of the original simulation-based model but offers significant speed-up by leveraging analytical, closed-form functions which are tuned during model training. The techniques presented in this chapter can be used to improve the performance of traditional design
space exploration algorithms.},

	abstract = {Programmable multi-core and many-core platforms increase exponentially the challenge of task mapping and scheduling, provided that enough task-parallelism does exist for each application. This problem worsens when dealing with small eco- systems such as embedded systems-on-chip. In fact, in this case, the assumption of exploiting a traditional operating system is out of context given the memory available to satisfy the run-time footprint of such a configuration.
An efficient Run-time Resource Management (RRM) becomes of paramount importance to dispatch tasks to the cores by taking into account the task-parallelization options that each application provides. State-of-the-art approaches to RRM try to allocate re- sources to maximize the instantaneous throughput while meeting a power budget constraint. In this paper, we will show that queuing theory can be an alternative yet effective way of solving resource allocation by presenting ARTE, an Application-specific Run-Time managEment framework. The framework exploits few assumptions about the target many-core computing fabric such as the availability of performance (throughput) information about the platform applications. We will show that this information can be combined, at run-time, with queuing models to enhance the response time of the applications by pounding the actual effect on the system power consumption better than previous approaches.
Experimental results show that, compared to reference state- of-the-art RRM techniques, ARTE is able to efficiently improve system performance by pro-actively reducing the response time while meeting the same power consumption requirements. Be- sides, we will show that the run-time overhead of ARTE does not significantly impact neither the system performance nor the on-chip-memory occupation.},

Moreover, the introduction of the hierarchy concept in the NoC design benefits from the main locality nature of the communication in MPSoC architectures. This paper presents a methodology to design Application Specific Hierarchical NoC (ASHiNoC) architectures considering foorplanning information. The presented approach targets heterogeneous clustered architectures where the intra-cluster communication is managed by a low-latency circuit-switched crossbar, while the inter-cluster communications are managed by a high-bandwidth packet-based NoC, allowing reg- ulars topologies. The proposed design flow faces the problem by starting from the cluster selection down-to the foorplanning-aware estimation of the interconnect performances in terms of latency, power, area within each cluster and for the backbone NoC. Exper- imental results show that the AHiNoC architecture is able to guar- antee an interconnection power and latency reduction of 49% and 33% respectively, at a cost of an area increment of 78% with respect to a flat topology version.},

	abstract = {Current multi-core design methodologies are facing increasing unpredictability in terms of quality due to the actual diversity of the workloads that characterize the deployment scenario. To this end, these systems expose a set of dynamic parameters which can be tuned at run-time to achieve a specified Quality of Service (QoS) in terms of performance. A run-time manager operating system module is in charge of matching the specified QoS with the available platform resources by manipulating the overall degree of task-level parallelism of each application as well as the frequency of operation of each of the system cores.

In this paper, we introduce a design space exploration framework for enabling and supporting enhanced resource management through software re-configuration on an industrial multi-core platform. From one side, the framework operates at design time to identify a set of promising operating points which represent the optimal trade-off in terms of the target power consumption and performance. The operating points are used after the system has been deployed to support an enhanced resource management policy. This is done by a light-weight resource management layer which filters and selects the optimal parallelism of each application and operating frequency of each core to achieve the QoS constraints imposed by the external world and/or the user.

We show how the proposed design-time and run-time techniques can be used to optimally manage the resources of a multiple-stream MPEG4 encoding chip dedicated to automotive cognitive safety tasks.},

In fact, the knowledge of few design points is used to predict the expected improvement of unknown configurations. We show that the correlation of the configurations within the multi-processor design space can be modeled successfully with analytical functions and, thus, speed up the overall exploration phase. This makes the proposed methodology a model-assisted heuristic that, for the first time, exploits the correlation about architectural configurations to converge to the solution of the multi-objective problem.},

A load value predictor is an architectural enhancement which speculates over the results of a micro-processor load instruction to speed-up the execution of the following instructions. The proposed architectural enhancement differs from a classic predictor due to an improved selection scheme that allows to activate the predictor only when a miss occurs in the first level of cache. We analyze the effectiveness of the selective predictor in terms of overall energy reduction and performance improvement. To this end, we show how the proposed predictor can produce benefits (in terms of overall cost) when the cache size of the SMT architecture is reduced and we compare it with a classic non-selective load value prediction scheme. The experimental results have been gathered with a state-of-the-art SMT simulator running the SPEC2000 benchmark suite, both in SMT and non-SMT mode.},

In this complex scenario, the multi-objective exploration of the huge design space of next generation CMPs cannot be anymore based on intuition and past experience of the design architects. An Automatic Design Space Exploration methodology is needed to support systematically the exploration and the quantitative comparison of the design alternatives in terms of multiple competing objectives (Pareto analysis). An overall design space exploration framework is needed to combine all optimizations into a global search space with a common interface to the simulation and evaluation tools. Our work focuses on the definition of an automatic multi-objective Design Space Exploration (DSE) framework for tuning Chip Multi-Processor architectures by evaluating a set of metrics (such as energy and delay) for the next generation embedded computing platforms. Multicube Explorer is an interactive open-source framework to enable the designer to automatically explore a design space of configurations for a parameterized architecture for which an executable model (use case simulator) exists. Multicube Explorer is an advanced multi-objective optimization framework which is entirely command-line/script driven and can be re-targeted to any configurable platform by writing a suitable XML design space definition file and providing a configurable simulator.},

The model accuracy and efficiency is improved by exploiting high-level platform simulation techniques. High-level simulation allows us to reduce the overall complexity of the neural network and improving its prediction power.

Experimental results show that the proposed techniques is able to reduce the number of simulations needed for the optimization without decreasing the quality of the obtained Pareto set.

In this approach, a wide range of platform parameters are tuned either at design-time or at run-time, to provide the best trade-offs in terms of the selected system figures of merit (such as power and throughput) for a dynamic application-specific workload. Among the design-time (hardware) configurable parameters we can find the memory sub-system configuration (e.g. cache size and associativity) and other architectural parameters such as the instruction-level parallelism of the system processors. Among the run-time (software) configurable parameters we can find the overall degree of task-level parallelism associated with each application running on the chip. Typically, while the design-time exploration is performed in the early development stages for a set of static parameters, the tuning of the run-time parameters is performed dynamically by a run-time management software module after the system has been deployed. In this paper, we introduce a methodology for identifying a hardware configuration which is robust with respect to the variable workload scenario introduced by the run-time management. Moreover, the proposed methodology is aimed at providing useful information about the optimal operating points of the applications in terms of task-level parallelism. The proposed methodology is based on the NSGA-II evolutionary heuristic algorithm assisted by an artificial neural network (ANN). We then introduce a run-time management policy capable to exploit the above information to maximize the performance of the system under power budget constraints.

More specifically, the present paper deals with the reduction of the complexity of the energy
model of K-issueVLIWprocessors from exponential with respect to the number of operations
within the Instruction Set O(|I SA|K ) to quadratic (O(K ∗ |I SA|2)). The complexity of the
energy model has been further simplified by automatically clustering the operations in the ISA
with respect to their average energy. Globally, the proposed approach reduces the complexity
of the characterization problem for a K-issue VLIW processor to quadratic (O(K ∗ |C|2))
with respect to the number of operation clusters. In this way, a more efficient characterization
of the VLIW core power consumption can been achieved, while preserving the accuracy of
the power estimates. The proposed model has been further extended to provide early power
figures and energy/performance trade-offs for multi-cluster VLIW architectures composed of
multiple data-path units and a single instruction cache control unit. The proposed high-level

With the spread of reconfigurable hardware such as FPGAs, embedded cryptographic hardware became cost-effective. Nevertheless, it is worthy to note that nowadays, even hardwired cryptographic algorithms are not safe. Attacks based on power consumption and electromagnetic Analysis, such as SPA, DPA and EMA have been successfully used to retrieve secret information stored in cryptographic devices. Besides performance in terms of area and throughput, designer of embedded cryptographic hardware must worry about the leakage of their implementations.
This paper deals with the leakage that occurs in the SW computation of AES on platforms equipepd with a cache memory through the miss events, which may allow to infer the secret key.},

some static information about the upcoming branch to reduce the hardware involved in the prediction, thus, the energy consumption. To analyze the effectiveness of the proposed low-power branch prediction scheme, we combined it with some well-known dynamic branch prediction techniques suitable for VLIW processors. The analyzed branch predictors are characterized by simple hardware implementations,

	abstract = {In this paper, we address the problem of the efficient exploration of the architectural design space for parameterized embedded systems. The exploration problem is multi-objective (e.g., energy and delay), so the main goal of this work is to find a good approximation of the Pareto-optimal configurations representing the best energy/delay trade-offs by varying the architectural parameters of the target system. In particular, the paper presents a Design Space Exploration (DSE) framework to simulate the target system and to dynamically profile the target applications. In the proposed DSE framework, a set of heuristic algorithms have been analyzed to reduce the overall exploration time by computing an approximated Pareto set of configurations with respect to the selected figures of merit. Once the approximated Pareto set has been built, the designer can quickly select the best system configuration satisfying the constraints. Experimental results, derived from the application of the proposed DSE framework to a superscalar architecture, show that the exploration time can be reduced by three orders of magnitude with respect to the full search approach, while maintaining a good level of accuracy.},

	abstract = {Modem networked embedded systems represent a growing market segment in which security is becoming an essential requirement. The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) specification is becoming the default choice for such type of systems; however, a proper software implementation of AES is of fundamental importance in order to achieve significant performance. Current implementations presented in the literature differ in terms of the amount of look-up tables used for precomputing the functions of the encryption/decryption phase. This raises some questions regarding which AES implementation is optimal for a specific system configuration that, up to now, has been only empirically solved. In this work, we present an analytical model to study and evaluate the performance of the possible AES implementations in the early phases of system development. We then show that the proposed high-level timing model captures, with significant accuracy, the actual performance of current AES applications and thus it can be used for the early evaluation of optimal AES implementations and to support the design space exploration phase. Validating experiments have been carried out on the Lx architecture, a scalable and customizable VLIW architecture developed by STMicroelectronics and HP Labs. Some final considerations are eventually reported about the relevant characteristics of the analyzed implementations and the role of the cache memory.},

	abstract = {Proposes a low-power approach to the design of embedded very long instruction word (VLIW) processor architectures based on the forwarding (or bypassing) hardware, which provides operands from interstage pipeline registers directly to the inputs of the function units. The power optimization technique exploits the forwarding paths to avoid the power cost of writing/reading short-lived variables to/from the register file (RF). Such optimization is justified by the fact that, in application-specific embedded systems, a significant number of variables are short-lived, that is, their liveness (from first definition to last use) spans only few instructions. Values of short-lived variables can thus be accessed directly through the forwarding registers, avoiding writeback to the RF by the producer instruction and successive read from the RF by the consumer instruction. The decision concerning the enabling of the RF writeback phase is taken at compile time by the compiler static scheduling algorithm. This approach implies a minimal overhead on the complexity of the processor control logic and, thus, no critical path increase. The application of the proposed solution to a VLIW embedded core has shown an average RF power saving of 7.8% with respect to the unoptimized approach on the given set of target benchmarks.},

proposed for the data-path of very long instruction word (VLIW)
pipelined processors that can be used to provide accurate power

analytical model takes into account several software-level parameters (such as instruction ordering, pipeline stall probability,
and instruction cache miss probability) as well as microarchitectural-level ones (such as pipeline stage power consumption per instruction) providing an efficient pipeline-aware instruction-level power estimation, whose accuracy is very close to those given by RT or gate-level simulations. The problem of instruction-level power characterization of a K-issue VLIW processor is O(N**2K ) where N is the number of operations in the ISA and K is the number of parallel instructions composing the very long instruction. One of the advantages of the proposed model consists of reducing the complexity of the characterization problem to O( K x N**2). The proposed model has been used to characterize a four-issue VLIW core with a six-stage pipeline, and its accuracy and efficiency has been compared with respect to energy estimates derived by gate-level simulation. Experimental results (carried out on a set of embedded DSP benchmarks) have demonstrated an average error in accuracy of 4.8% of the instruction-level estimation engine with respect to the gate-level engine.
